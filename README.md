# asciiterm

A simple script to print random ascii arts into the terminal. <br> 
You just need to put the ascii-arts in txt files with .asii extension into the ascii folder. <br>
I preloaded the folder with ascii art frrom the game Portal 2, I also put 2 coloring commands into the script to print the ascii in yellow.<br>

Tip: Run the randomascii.sh in your .bashrc file, so it will open a random asciiart whenever you open a terminal.
